<p><a href="https://youtu.be/9hIQjrMHTv4">This video</a> explains how key ideas from early network implementations come together in the modern internet.</p>
<h2 id="list-of-terms">List of terms</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Batch processing</dt>
<dd><p>operating a single process at a time</p>
</dd>
<dt>Time sharing</dt>
<dd><p>sharing the processing power of a single computer with multiple users</p>
</dd>
<dt>DARPA</dt>
<dd><p>Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (1958), which planned the development of a network for accelerated knowledge transfer</p>
</dd>
<dt>ARPANET</dt>
<dd><p>Network implemented (1966) by DARPA</p>
</dd>
<dt>IMP subnet</dt>
<dd><p>network of interface message processors (IMPs), the computers in ARPANET that interface the mainframes at given locations</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCP</dt>
<dd><p>Transmission control protocol, the successor of the network control protocol (NCP) designed by the network working group for ARPANET. It connects computers through gateways and verifies file transfer.</p>
</dd>
<dt>packet-switching</dt>
<dd><p>the principle of sending files in small packets which are put back together at the receiver end, done to prevent congestion. Implemented first by the National Physics Laboratory (NPL)</p>
</dd>
<dt>decentralized, distributed networks</dt>
<dd><p>the principle of connecting computers with each other (implemented in ARPANET) in a way that makes networks less vulnerable and transmissions less susceptible to interference</p>
</dd>
<dt>inter-net</dt>
<dd><p>the communication between small computer networks as focused on by the CYCLADES scientific network.</p>
</dd>
<dt>transfer nodes</dt>
<dd><p>connecting computers that do not intervene in the communication between a sender and a receiver. In CYCLADES, this was enabled by embedding the transmission protocol in a physical hardware layer in each computer. This provided a direct connection to the receiver and an end-to-end structure.</p>
</dd>
<dt>X.25</dt>
<dd><p>telephone protocol in which communication proceeds through servers (in exchange for a fee)</p>
</dd>
<dt>OSI</dt>
<dd><p>the Open System Interconnection reference model designed by the ISO, the objective of which included standardization of a network from its ends and division of communication channels into separate layers</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCP-IP</dt>
<dd><p>implementation of the OSI model into TCP, guaranteeing compatibility between networks, allowing them to be merged into the internet.</p>
