# History of the Internet

[This video](https://youtu.be/9hIQjrMHTv4) explains how key 
ideas from early network implementations come together in
the modern internet. 


## List of terms

Batch processing

:   operating a single process at a time

Time sharing

:   sharing the processing power of a single computer with multiple users

DARPA

:   Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (1958), which planned the development of a network for accelerated knowledge transfer

ARPANET

:   Network implemented (1966) by DARPA

IMP subnet

:   network of interface message processors (IMPs), the computers in ARPANET that interface the mainframes at given locations

TCP

:   Transmission control protocol, the successor of the network control protocol (NCP) designed by the network working group for ARPANET. It connects computers through gateways and verifies file transfer.

packet-switching

:   the principle of sending files in small packets which are put back together at the receiver end, done to prevent congestion. Implemented first by the National Physics Laboratory (NPL)

decentralized, distributed networks

:   the principle of connecting computers with each other (implemented in ARPANET) in a way that makes networks less vulnerable and transmissions less susceptible to interference

inter-net

:   the communication between small computer networks as focused on by the CYCLADES scientific network. 

transfer nodes

:   connecting computers that do not intervene in the communication between a sender and a receiver. In CYCLADES, this was enabled by embedding the transmission protocol in a physical hardware layer in each computer. This provided a direct connection to the receiver and an end-to-end structure.

X.25

:   telephone protocol in which communication proceeds through servers (in exchange for a fee)

OSI

:   the Open System Interconnection reference model designed by the ISO, the objective of which included standardization of a network from its ends and division of communication channels into separate layers

TCP-IP

:   implementation of the OSI model into TCP, guaranteeing compatibility between networks, allowing them to be merged into the internet.
