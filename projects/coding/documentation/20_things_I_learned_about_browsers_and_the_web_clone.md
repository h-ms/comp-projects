# 20 Things

[This book](http://www.20thingsilearned.com/en-US) describes the history and current developments in web browser technology.


## What is the internet

internet

:   the physical backbone of the web

web

:   inter-linked internet pages and applications

TCP/IP

:   Designed in 1974, a set of rules for connecting computers and allowing them to exchange information

bandwidth

:   amount of data that can be sent over an internet connection per second


## Cloud computing

cloud computing

:   using the collective power of computers connected to the internet to retrieve and store information,
    enabling us to perform many tasks 'online'
   
   
## Web apps

4 advantages of web abbs over desktop apps

1.  can be accessed anywhere from any device connected to the internet

2.  auto-updates ensure only one version (the latest) is around
 
3.  platform independent (any browser on any device)

4.  safer because they are not downloaded and therefore do not interfere with other processes on the computer


## HTML, JavaScript, CSS and more

XHR

:   XMLHttpRequest, a JavaScript feature that allows individual parts of a web page to be altered without the need 
    to reload the entire page, resulting in faster and more responsive pages

AJAX

:   Asynchronous JavaScript and XML: the combined power of JavaScript, XHR, CSS and other technologies 


## HTML5

Version of HTML developed to facilitate the creation of online apps. Functionality includes

-   videos
-   drag-and-drop
-   offline actions


## 3D in the browser

3D rendering is data-intensive. Its implementation in the browser has been enabled by:

-   higher bandwidth
-   faster processors
-   more memory
-   hardware acceleration: using the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to speed up computations
-   software technologies: webGL, 3D CSS


## A browser madrigal

Upgrading out-of-date browsers is important because

-   out-of-date browsers lack security fixes and features
-   only up-to-date browsers have the speed improvements that allow running the latest features on web sites and apps
-   the use of old browsers slows down innovation because developers will develop for the lowest common denominator


## Plug-ins

Plug-ins

:   pieces of software that process special types of content that browsers on their own cannot handle

Plug-ins operate relatively independently of the browser, which allows them to work across many different browsers.
This, and the fact that they also can get outdated, makes them vulnerable to attacks.

The modernization of plug-ins involves integrating them more seamlessly with the browser, allowing them to be auto-updatable and their content to be searchable 


## Browser extensions

Extensions add new features to your browser. They can interact with web pages or with software on your pc.
They are nowadays programmed in the languages of the web.


## Synchronizing the browser

Modern browsers have sync functionality, allowing your browser settings, bookmarks and extensions to be saved in the cloud.


## Browser cookies

A cookie is a piece of information that a website you visit sends to your browser. When retrieved at the next visit (or at a later time at the current visit) it provides the website with memories of your preferences.
Types of cookies include session-only cookies, permanent cookies, flash cookies. Rules for accepting cookies can be set up on a site-by-site basis.


## Browsers and privacy

Privacy-sensitive information includes the browsing history, downloads, cookies, passwords and form data.
These can all be cleared through options or preferences menus. Incognito mode prevents browser history recording and auto-removes cookies at the end of the session.


## How modern browsers protect against malware and phishing

1.  Safe browsing technology warns users when they try to access a website that occurs on a list of suspicious sites.
2.  Browser auto-updates ensure that the latest security patches have been installed.
3.  Sandboxes are contained environments in the browser that prevent malware from entering the hard disk.


## Using web addresses to stay safe

URL

:   uniform resource locator (the web address)

scheme

:   the first part of a URL, for example `http://` or 'hypertext transfer protocol'. The `https://` scheme with a padlock icon in the browser address bar ensures that the connection between web server and browser is secure.

hostname

:   the part of a URL following the scheme, e.g. `www.google.com`. The host name is uniquely registered to a person or company!

path

:   gives a location on the host. It is sometimes moved to the front of the hostname to become a full 'subdomain' (`news.google.com`)


## Validating identities online

Extended validation certificate

:   information (displayed in the web browser address bar) that allows you to determine the name of the organization that runs the website


## Evolving to a faster web

-   Compression techniques are used to scale down the sizes of images and videos
-   JavaScript engines have improved and process JS code faster
-   DNS pre-resolution resolves not only the IP address of the requested site but also those of the links appearing on that site.


## Open source and browsers

Mozilla Firefox is an example of an open-source browser. Apache HTTP server is open-source web-server software.

Webkit

:   An open-source rendering engine

The web created by the open-source community forms the broad shoulders for the next generation.
