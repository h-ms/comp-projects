# What is the internet, really?

[This video](https://youtu.be/XE_FPEFpHt4) explains how 
the internet is physical, consisting of cables, 
connection hubs, landing stations and amplifiers.

The physics of internet connections are simple: light goes in at one place and comes out at the other.
The cables on the ocean floor carry 50 Gbit/s of information. They consist of about 8 fibers (4 going in each direction),
each of which carries 50-70 different wavelengths of light. Every 50 miles the signal is amplified by amplifiers.
