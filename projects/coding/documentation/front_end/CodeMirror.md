# Code editor: CodeMirror

[This page](http://web.mit.edu/xavid/Public/bazki/lib/ext/codemirror/) introduces CodeMirror.
This text editing JS library is used by CodeAnywhere.

In CodeAnywhere, preferences (including key bindings and autocompletion) can be set by user or project.
Changes to the default settings can be obtained in text form using the `Open as JSON` option in `Preferences`.

All default keybindings (as per 2016-09-16) are given on page <http://docs.codeanywhere.com/preferences/commandsandkeybindings.html>.
E.g. `Alt-x` toggles File Explorer.

Highlighting is supported for languages including R (default extension `.r`).
