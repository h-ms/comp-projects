<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XE_FPEFpHt4">This video</a> explains how the internet is physical, consisting of cables, connection hubs, landing stations and amplifiers.</p>
<p>The physics of internet connections are simple: light goes in at one place and comes out at the other. The cables on the ocean floor carry 50 Gbit/s of information. They consist of about 8 fibers (4 going in each direction), each of which carries 50-70 different wavelengths of light. Every 50 miles the signal is amplified by amplifiers.</p>
